Ubuntu Touch for lancelot is based on Halium 11 and Android 11 Ubuntu Touch rootfs so it requires an Android 11 base firmware before it can be flashed on your phone.
While custom ROMs like LineageOS 18.1 might work, they are untested and not recommended. Instead, use one of the MIUI Android 11 based firmware from below.


!! Pay attention to your device name before downloading the firmware below. Make sure you download the right firmware for your device, the correct region, the firmware type is fastboot, and the **Android** version is **11.0** !!
